## Project 8: Kidnapped Vehicle

### Overview
---
The goal of this project is to implement localization of a Kidnapped Vehicle using a 2 dimensional Particle Filter. The Particle Filter is given a map and some initial localization information. At each time step the filter also gets observation and control data.

The project includes following steps:
* Completion of the [project template](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Kidnapped-Vehicle-Project) C++ source code in order to build a 2 dimentional Particle Filter by applying the general processing flow as described in the class lessons
* Testing of the Particle Filter code with input data generated by the [Term 2 Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

### Project directory content:

* [README.md](README.md) - This file.
* [src/](src/) folder:
   - project C++ source code files
   - [CMakeLists.txt](src/CMakeLists.txt) - `cmake` input file to generate the project `Makefile`. It was moved to the `src` folder and adopted to generate an `Eclipse` project - thanks to [Eclipse IDE profile](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project/tree/master/ide_profiles/Eclipse) repo for provided instructions. 
* [data/](data/) folder:
    - [map_data.txt](data/map_data.txt) - map inputs to the particle filter with with the position of landmarks (in meters) on an arbitrary Cartesian coordinate system 

### Project Environment


The project code was built and executed on a Linux VMware guest.

### Project Build instructions

1. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
2. Compile the code: `cmake ../src/ && make` (Please note that `CMakeList.txt` file is located in folder `src/`)
3. Run the code: `./particle_filter`
Alternatively use the following scripts to streamline this process, these can be leveraged by executing the following in the top directory of the project:
1. `./clean.sh`
2. `./build.sh`
3. `./run.sh`

### Project results

The provided implementation of the particle filter passes the current grading code in the simulator.

### Issues

An error `"Segmentation fault (core dumped)"` is reported after `h.onDisconnection()` call.
